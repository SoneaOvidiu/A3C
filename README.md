This is a implementation of the A3C algorithm that is trained to play the Atari game Breakout.

The implementation is for Python 2.7 using Linux as operating system.

When the the main.py file is being run where will be a lot of deprecation errors but the algorithm works. Until you see the first results it may take up to 5 minutes.

To give the user a better idea about the algorithms performance I made a ProcesedData.txt file which contains inforamtion about the training and the progress the AI has made so far.

The brain.pkl is the file that contains the trained brain so that any new users of the algorithm are not required to go through a long learning phase.

Before you can run the main.py file you have to make sure that you have all the libreries installed.

The required libraries are:

-torch

-os

-cv2

-gym

-numpy

-time

-pickle
